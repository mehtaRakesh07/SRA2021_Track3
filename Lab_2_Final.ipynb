    "The problem that saturation causes is that it makes photometry very difficult. For instance, how many photons hit a saturated pixel with 100,000 counts?\n",
    "\n",
    "You don't know, you just know that it was over some threshold. It is akin to placing a 100 ounce bucket out in the street on a rainy day. At the end of the day, you might find that the bucket is full. How many ounces of water fell into the bucket? You only know that it was at least 100 ounces. It could have been 300 ounces or 101 or 250... you just don't know.\n",
    "\n",
    "What is worth with CCD's, and has no analogy to buckets of water, is that after a number of counts (about 60,000 for the 0.4 meter SBIG cameras) they go *nonlinear*. Meaning it might take 1000 photons to elevate a pixel's counts from 50,000 to 60,000, but then it might take 1500 photons to elevate the counts from 60,000 to 70,000. So again, this makes photometry nearly impossible."

    "To reduce the number of counts, you can reduce the exposure time. The minimum observation time is 1 second. The shutter on the camera cannot open nor close much faster. There is a way to avoid saturation without reducing observation time. This is achieved by defocusing the telescope. Defocusing the telescope spreads the light out into a donut, making it cast further over the chip. One can do this with the \"Defocus\" parameter when you are scheduling an observation. A decent value is 0.2 or 0.3 mm.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, the 0.4 meters have a hardware flaw that causes them to sometimes *not return to the original focus*. For this reason, we recommend you do not use the defocus. You can -- but do it at your own risk.. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The easiest solution, frankly, is to pick a source that is fainter. Something around 6th or 7th magnitude, and then take 10 or 20 second observations (or however long you find that you need).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The signal to noise calculator also gives the \"peak counts\" in  PkDN. This is the highest number of counts you can expect to exist for the star you are observing. You should observe so that in practice, you get between 10,000 and 40,000 counts. However, this is where things get hard.\n",
    "The S/N calculator is only approximate. These things complicate the observation\n",
    "* Thin clouds above the telescope. Thin clouds will decrease the signal to noise and peak counts of the observation. In bad cases, where a thick cloud passes overhead, entire exposures may be aborted because the guide star (What the telescope \"locks\" onto) may be lost.\n",
    "* How low above the horizon the star is. This is characterize by the \"air mass\" parameter. Note that in your observation request, you can select the maximum airmass you want to observe through. Exactly at zenith (right overhead) corresponds to an air mass of 1. Typical observations restrict your request to a cone with an opening angle of 104 degrees -- or 52 degrees off the horizon. This is an airmass of 1.6. Lower on the horizon corresponds to higher air mass. https://www.pveducation.org/pvcdrom/properties-of-sunlight/air-mass"
